# Commit step by step notes.

Starting from now I'll change the Readme with every observation.

## Initial Commit

Creating the public repo.

## Initial setup with create-react-app

I'll be using create-react-app for this challenge since this is a fast way to create a comfortable development environment, I did a few things on the first commit, after bootstraping the application with create-react-app I did some cleanup of things that I was not going to need from the start, changed the favicon icon, website name and removed some files, styles and comments that the setup left, in the next commit I'll start thinking about how I am going to do the file architecture with the redux store in mind.
